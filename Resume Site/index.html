      <h2 class="card-header">Dice Roll Game</h2>
      <p class="card-text">A simple, text-based game that I made using Python. The game takes input from the user as a ready-check then
      uses Python's "random" library to roll a random number 1 through 6. The player gets a random number and the computer gets a random number. 
      Finally, the two numbers are compared to see who wins.</p>

    <img src="img/basketball.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <div class="text">One of my favorite things is watching or playing basketball. I played throughout high school,
    starting as point guard from my freshman year and playing travel ball as well. I'm also a die-hard Lakers fan!</div>

    <div class="text">Believe it or not, I really enjoy coding and constantly learning and being challenged by it. The most
    satisfying feeling in the world is when you have been working on a problem and FINALLY get it to work. Or when you're in
    the zone and write a big chunk of code and it runs the first time with no errors.</div>

    <div class="text">Of course, anyone who's ever worked with computers has to game on them right? I play games like League of
    Legends, CS:GO and Rust just to name a few. If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them!</div>
